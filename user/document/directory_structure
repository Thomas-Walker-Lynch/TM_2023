Think of a directory name as an attribute given to each file in the directory.

 incantatio-loadable/ - git ignored, for makefile built excecutables (incantatio, singing)
   experiment/ 
   production/
   test/
 deprecated/ - old stuff kept around for easy access typically sake of example
 document/ 
 incantatio-C/ - source code 
   experiment/
   production/
   test/
 library/ - git ignored, makefile generated object code and libs
 resource/ - stuff of general use that is not git ignored
 temporary/ - git ignored

A word for a 'book of incantatio', use this for a 'package':
  incantamentarium
