Lexical scope is not the same as dynamic scope in C.

Variables within braces can only be linked symbolically within the braces.

In C the variables remain on the stack frame, so can be referenced by address
until the stack frame is popped.

All the sequence work is done inside of main, so all variables in braces
are stack base allocated.  Their stack frame does not get popped until
the program ends.

Hence braces can be used for their benifit of having short names without
conflicting with the names of variables in other sets of braces, while
the addresses of these variables my placed into objects and they
may continued to be used.
